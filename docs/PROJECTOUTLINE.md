- Validate pricing accuracy across different market conditions

### Key Components
**Implementation:**
- Heston stochastic volatility model with characteristic function
- COS method for ground truth option pricing

- Baseline models (MLP, SVR) for comparison

**Data Generation:**
- 10,000+ synthetic option contracts
- Parameters: S₀, K, T, r, κ, θ, σ, ρ, v₀
- Train/validation/test split: 70/15/15

**Experiments:**
- Hidden neurons: [50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]
- Activations: sigmoid, tanh, ReLU
- Regularization C: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]

**Deliverables:**
- `src/elm/data/generators.py` - Synthetic option data utilities
- `src/elm/models/pricing/elm_pricer.py` - ELM option pricing workflows
- `notebooks/01_options_pricing.ipynb` - Training and analysis
